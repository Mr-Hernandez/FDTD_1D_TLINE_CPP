# FDTD_1D_TLINE_CPP

This program does calculations on a transmission line and saves the values to a txt file. 
Each time a file is written gnuplot is called and plots the data file. 
In this way it can plot a transmission line signal so we can see the progression. 
The purpose was meant to read real time data and the transmission line is just used as an example.
